# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: Unity

## Project: **X**

---

###10/14X24:
* I was unable to start Unity for now so instead I started to read the Documentation
* Game View VS Scene view
  Game view shows how the game looks through the player
  
  Scene view allows you to navigate through the scene of the game (such as a 3D/2D rendering of the background)

There are a lot of graphics that Unity has built in that lets you get started easier
Scripting allows the players to input commands and lets the game do something
* We can choose our own code editor (our workspace) when working with scripts

### X/X/XX:

* Things you tried, progress you made, etc
* Challenges, a-ha moments, etc
* Questions you still have
* What you're going to try next
