# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: Unity

## Project: **X**

---

### 10/14/24:
* I was unable to start Unity for now so instead I started to read the Documentation
* Game View VS Scene view
  Game view shows how the game looks through the player
  
  Scene view allows you to navigate through the scene of the game (such as a 3D/2D rendering of the background)

There are a lot of graphics that Unity has built in that lets you get started easier
Scripting allows the players to input commands and lets the game do something
* We can choose our own code editor (our workspace) when working with scripts

### 10/20/24:
I downloaded unity and tried some basic tools
Using a tutorial, I learned the UI of the app and what it contains
* The project pannel contains what is going to be in the project
* scene is what you see
* hierachy lists all the object in the current level
* inspector allows you to change those objects
Following the tutorial, I tried adding physics and adding a component to a cube (gravity)

using videos from this site: https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/g101/start/index.html

* node is an object that can represent some kind of specialized game function
* nodes are the "objects" or maybe classes
* created a sprite2D node and inspected it to see its properties
* sprite2D is an object of multiple other classes, each time adding on a new property
* you can put a node inside another node and it will become its "children" - if you move the adult, the child will also move
* you can attach a script to a node and use it to control the node
