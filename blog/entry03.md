During the break, I decided to brainstorm ideas for sprites for my freedom project and it was going to look like. The break was when me and my group decided to get started on our freedom project by putting things together and the first thing we needed were the assets we were going to use. Through the use of an online website called [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite) where I created the sprites of the building and character where the character was 16x16 pixels while the buildings were 32x32. Here is a [image](CharacterModel.png) of what I created. 

Since we were getting started by creating our project, we needed to collaborate and connect our godot project together. Through a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ-CJIYPFMI), we followed the steps so our godot files would be connected to Github if we make any changes. This process was extremely confusing because the tutorial would only show for the person that would be making the project but wouldn't show how it would connect the other group members. After much dificultly, we were finally able to connect our project together. 

My group members were also working on the technical parts of the game. They created movement and collison with the temperary assets given by Godot but I replaced them with the sprites that I created. Even though the parts they worked on functioned, the technical part of it was confusing to work with and not smooth for a game. Therefore, we decided to work together and work on the project to try and find the mistake. We eventually solved it and I hope many of our future issues with our code and project would go smoothly as well. 

Our group is currently on planning and creating a prototype of the Engineering Design Process (EDP). We started to create the start of our project and are hoping to continue forward with greater improvements but also hoping to go at a faster pace. Some skills I developed is communication. When we were combining our work together, I was the last person to be able to connect the project. Because of this, I was a little scared that I was unable to. However, I spoke up about it and my partner Zi Xuan help me with the issues I was dealing with. I also developed the skill "How to learn" because I needed a way to do pixels. I tried to use online art apps but they didnt work because it was difficult to set up. However, Piskel was quick and web-based where I had to quickly learn the tools and created my sprites.
