# Entry 2
##### 12/6/25

  Nearing the start of December into winter break, I wanted to get started on making my project. Therefore, I started to do research on the type of game that my group wanted. As a group, we decided that we wanted to make a tilemap game using godot and we were able to control a character in the game as a "major" or "leader". This way, we were able to use our knowledge of creating a node and use it as a camera. 

  Using Godot's tilemap features, I was able to create a tile map of my own and display run the game (with just the map itself. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZutpG0_CYrQ), where it taught me how to use Godots tile maps. This included importing, dragging files, and adding layers. Using a template tileset from online, I practiced using the tilemap features for a couple minutes until I got accustomed to the system and how it worked. Later, using the same tilemap from before and [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4AQtCWNQmo), I made some of the tiles in the tilemap somewhat interactable. For example, there were these chests that I used as the template for what was interactable. When I would run Godot and clicked on the treasure chest, the treasure chest would disappear. Here, I had to learn some GDscript and I realised how confused it was going to become after I learn more. 

  My partners and I decided that during the break, we should merge our Godot projects through github. This way, we can make our edits through Godot but still see changes from other people. I also said that I wanted to create the tilemaps for our game specificly. We were making a settlement game and we needed characters, buildings and more. We were able to take the grass and rocks from other tilesets but for our game, we needed our own sprites. This became my job as I developed sprites using the art Software Krita. I made the first draft of the sprite and I hope they are good enough for a decent start for our code. 

  This is the third and fourth part of the Engineering Design Process(EDP), where we brainstorm what our game can be and plan our some features that would be in our game. 
  Some skills I developed through this process is collaboration because this is the first time I am working with partners for my freedom project and I had to learn to talk to my group about my ideas. I also practice how to read because while searching for available tools to learn, I read some documentation to get a grasp of the tool. Watching full videos would take too long so I had to go through the documenation effectively to know what the advantages and disadvantages were.
