  Nearing the start of December into winter break, I wanted to get started on making my project. Therefore, I started to do research on the type of game that my group wanted. As a group, we decided that we wanted to make a tilemap game using godot and we were able to control a character in the game as a "major" or "leader". This way, we were able to use our knowledge of creating a node and use it as a camera. 

  Using Godot's tilemap features, I was able to create a tile map of my own and display run the game (with just the map itself. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZutpG0_CYrQ), where it taught me how to use Godots tile maps. This included importing, dragging files, and adding layers. Using a template tileset from online, I practiced using the tilemap features for a couple minutes until I got accustomed to the system and how it worked. Later, using the same tilemap from before and [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4AQtCWNQmo), I made some of the tiles in the tilemap somewhat interactable. For example, there were these chests that I used as the template for what was interactable. When I would run Godot and clicked on the treasure chest, the treasure chest would disappear. Here, I had to learn some GDscript and I realised how confused it was going to become after I learn more. 

  During the break, I think we should get started on making the sprites for the project. I need to figure a way to find how people make tilesets so I can make sprites of the buildings and characters for our own game. I also need to learn more GDscript in Godot because it is the main way commands will work in Godot. Even though there are many features and things to add in Godot, we still need to tell them what to do in GDscript.

  This is the third and fourth part of the Engineering Design Process(EDP), where we brainstorm what our game can be and plan our some features that would be in our game. We have decided how the game will play and the choices that the player will make to learn more about history. Some skills I developed through this process is How to Google. There were many tutorials where I was very confused on how they work and how to import files. The tutorials and documentations that I was finding was not working at times where I had to think about if it would be useful for my own project. I also developed Problem Decomposition because as a group, we needed to put things into smaller steps. If we try to complete the game without any objectives, then it will be very confusing. We need give certain tasks for each person so we know how to deal with our project together, step by step.
