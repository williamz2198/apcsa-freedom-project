  During this year's freedom project, I decided that I wanted to create a game using a game engine called Godot. I wanted to create a game with a better concept than last year, so I decided to work with 2 other partners for this project. Last year, there were times I was stuck on my tool and there was no other person I could ask about my tool, so I couldn't ask anyone for help. I wanted to be able to get more done on my project and add a lot of fun and unique things. With a partner, I think I will able to accomplish more with more help. 

  We were going to create a game so we wanted to make it easier using a game engine. The most well know game engine to us was Unity so we tried to use Unity but I was having some issues with downloading and the tutorials were several years old, making them unreliable. Because of this, we decided to try Godot and it was easier to start with because the tutorials were newer and the download (for me) was easier than Unity. 

  Following some [tutorials](https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/g101/start/index.html) for some basic creation of an object (nord) and the [documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html) to know the aspects/properties of each object. Using the tutorial, I create a 2D sprite of Godots logo and tried to change some properties. I wanted to try what Godot has but then I realised that the scripts of Godot is used to manipulate the objects of Godot. Using the documentation, I moved the icon but I want to use a youtube tutorial next time to try and change more things. 

  This is the first step of the engineering design process (EDP) where we are currently finding ways to create something that can help. My group has decided to create a game that is based on historical events so it can be a fun way for people to learn about outcomes of possible events in history.
