# Entry 6
##### 6/2/25

For our last portion of our freedom project, we shared our project through an in-class presentation and presented our project during the school expo. We are on the final step of the Engineer Design Process where we communicate our results of our year long project to others. Me and my group have worked hard on this project and wanted to share our hardwork with other people. 
Throughout high school, I was extremely nervous about presentations where I would worry about the presentation for countless days until the presentations started but this year, it was less scary. Our [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o1J2jjSPWHZM6Ct8P2ob6UwUpwdKB43gpU11VMH_J6w/edit?slide=id.g357e726750f_0_76#slide=id.g357e726750f_0_76) was split up so I would do the introduction, my partner Benjamin would show our project demonstration and ZiXuan(Yu) would show our takeaways. We would each show one part of the process during the project that we worked on. I wanted the hook of our presentation to be interesting and not just some generic question. But, it was rather difficult to come up with something. Then, back at home while discussing the presentation with my partners, we remembered our goal of our project: to teach people about the difficulties Europeans had to go through when creating a new settlement. As a result, I created [plan](https://github.com/williamz2198/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/presentation.md) with a hook that created a story as if the viewer would go through the story of our character. 

Here is the script that I made in the speaker notes:

* Once a upon a time, YOU once lived in the towns of Europe. You loved being with your friends and family but sadly, you were not happy with this life.
* You were thinking about living a life with a lot more money. Maybe…you can create a new life for yourself.
* And so, a journey of begins as you decide to set sail to find new land. You bring wood, some people and limited money.
* And After many countless, dreadful nights…
* You arrive in the new land, Welcome to the new settlement!

During our presentations, it was relatively easy to present my process because I have been working on my project and I know all about what I have been working on. I talked about the Z-axis when layering and the other issues on my tilemap. I was a little nervous because I was not fully ready for what I was going to say. In the future, I would practice the presentation with my friends either in person or through a voice call. 

Afterwards, we also had to present our project in the expo. Through the same way we presented the project, we also presented our project to the judges. Even though I think we did pretty well, I think I should've been more uplifting and should've used my intro from my presentation in my elevator pitch. I only practiced a little bit of my elevator pitch and I wished I did a little more. I needed to make sure my elevator pitch was more engaging for a better score.

Overall, I really enjoyed making this project with my groupmates. They were the first people I met in high school and I enjoyed using our strengths to work on this project. Throughout these presentations, I developed the skills of communication and creativity. I needed to be brave and correctly articulate my thoughts throughout my presentation through communication and if I messed up, I need to pick myself back up and recover. I also developed creativity because I needed to think outside the box when making my slides more interesting. I wanted the slides and presentation to be interesting and thought of a creative way to explain my hook.
