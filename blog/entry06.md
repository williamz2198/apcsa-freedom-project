# Entry 6
##### 6/2/25

For our last portion of our freedom project, we shared our project through an in-class presentation and presented our project during the school expo. We are on the final step of the Engineer Design Process where we communicate our results of our year long project to others. Me and my group have worked hard on this project and wanted to share our hardwork with other people. 
Throughout high school, I was extremely nervous about presentations where I would worry about the presentation for countless days until the presentations started but this year, it was less scary. Our [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o1J2jjSPWHZM6Ct8P2ob6UwUpwdKB43gpU11VMH_J6w/edit?slide=id.g357e726750f_0_76#slide=id.g357e726750f_0_76) was split up so I would do the introduction, my partner Benjamin would show our project demonstration and ZiXuan(Yu) would show our takeaways. We would each show one part of the process during the project that we worked on. I wanted the hook of our presentation to be interesting and not just some generic question. But, it was rather difficult to come up with something. Then, back at home while discussing the presentation with my partners, we remembered our goal of our project: to teach people about the difficulties Europeans had to go through when creating a new settlement. As a result, I created a hook that created a story as if the viewer would go through the story of our character. 

Here is the script that I made in the speaker notes:

* Once a upon a time, YOU once lived in the towns of Europe. You loved being with your friends and family but sadly, you were not happy with this life.
* You were thinking about living a life with a lot more money. Maybe…you can create a new life for yourself.
* And so, a journey of begins as you decide to set sail to find new land. You bring wood, some people and limited money.
* And After many countless, dreadful nights…
